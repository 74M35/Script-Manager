# F1M Script Manager

Requirements : 
Python 3

Safety : 
Always make a copy of your save before running a script in case it breaks something

How to install :
Extract the contents of this archive in your F1 Manager 22 save folder (it should be "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\F1Manager22\Saved\SaveGames").

How to use :
Launch script_manager.py, it allows you to select the script you want to run and the save you want to run it on. A dummy script that should simply display a short text in the console is included.

How does the sprint race simulation works :
1. Save your game before starting the Imola/Austria/Brazil weekends.
2. Execute the "set_sprint.py" script.
3. Reload your save.
4. Play the weekend with the sprint race.
5. Start the next race weekend that is at the same track.
6. SAVE BEFORE STARTING FP1.
7. Execute the "set_race.py" script.
8. Reload your save.
9. Play the normal race.

Known issues :
Unless they have damage, AI won't pit during this race and will be disqualified. The points are adjusted properly when running the "set_race.py" script.
